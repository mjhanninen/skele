Skele
=====

**Skele** is a command line utility for computing unique passwords for
different services and identities.

Skele is based on the idea that you can use a cryptographic password in
combination with your identity to calculate a password that you can use with
your identity to form your credentials.


Usage
-----

Assuming you have generated yourself a [cryptographic passphrase][diceware]
(like `foo bar baz` below) you can generate yourself unique passwords tied to
your online identity as follows:

    $ skele
    Please enter the skeleton key:
    > <foo bar baz>
    Please re-enter the skeleton key to confirm:
    > <foo bar baz>
    Please enter the service name:
    > example.com
    Please enter the user name:
    > john
