**Skele** is a command line utility for computing unique passwords for
different services and identities.

Skele is based on the idea that you can use a cryptographic password in
combination with your identity to calculate a password that you can use with
your identity to form your credentials.


Usage
-----

Assuming you have generated yourself a [cryptographic passphrase][diceware]
(like `foo bar baz` below) you can generate yourself unique passwords tied to
your online identity as follows:

```
$ skele
Skele, version 0.2.0
Skeleton key?
> <your skeleton key, e.g. "foo bar baz">
Please re-enter the skeleton key to confirm
> <e.g. "foo bar baz" again>
Confirmed: The fingerprint of the skeleton key is 9Ygh1tcz
Domain?
> example.com
Identity?
> john
